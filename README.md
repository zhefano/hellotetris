# Hello Tetris - iOS Game

A classic Tetris implementation built with Swift 6.2, SpriteKit, and iOS 26 features.

## 🎮 Features

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: All 7 standard Tetrimino pieces (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z)
- **Smooth Controls**: Touch and keyboard support
- **Score System**: Points for clearing lines
- **Game Over Detection**: Automatic game over when pieces can't be placed
- **Modern iOS Design**: Built with latest Swift and SpriteKit features
- **Actor-based Architecture**: Uses Swift 6.2's enhanced concurrency features

## 🛠️ Recent Fixes

The project had several issues that have been resolved:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Actor Isolation Errors**: Removed conflicting `@MainActor` annotations that were causing build failures
2. **Missing Type Definitions**: Properly defined `TetriminoBlock`, `GameUpdateResult`, and `PiecePosition` structs
3. **Incomplete Game Logic**: Implemented full piece movement, spawning, and game loop
4. **Concurrency Issues**: Fixed async/await usage in the game engine
5. **UI Integration**: Properly connected SpriteKit scene with game logic

### 🔧 Technical Improvements:
- **Swift 6.2 Compatibility**: Updated to use latest Swift concurrency features
- **Actor-based Game Engine**: Thread-safe game state management
- **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful handling of game over conditions
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient rendering and update loops

## 🎯 How to Play

### Touch Controls
- **Left third of screen**: Move piece left
- **Right third of screen**: Move piece right  
- **Center third of screen**: Rotate piece

### Keyboard Controls (iOS Simulator/External Keyboard)
- **Left Arrow**: Move piece left
- **Right Arrow**: Move piece right
- **Down Arrow**: Drop piece faster
- **Up Arrow** or **Spacebar**: Rotate piece
- **R**: Restart game

## 🚀 Building and Running

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Xcode 16.0 or later
   - iOS 26.0 SDK
   - Swift 6.2

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   cd hellotetris
   xcodebuild -project hellotetris.xcodeproj -scheme hellotetris -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
   ```

3. **Run in Simulator**:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project hellotetris.xcodeproj -scheme hellotetris -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
   ```

## 🎨 Game Architecture

### Core Components:

1. **GameEngine (Actor)**: 
   - Manages game state
   - Handles piece movement and collision detection
   - Thread-safe operations

2. **GameBoard (Class)**:
   - Represents the game grid
   - Handles piece placement and line clearing
   - Collision detection

3. **TetriminoPiece (Observable Class)**:
   - Defines piece shapes and rotations
   - Color and visual properties
   - All 7 standard Tetris pieces

4. **GameScene (SKScene)**:
   - SpriteKit rendering
   - Touch input handling
   - Visual feedback

## 🎯 Game Rules

- **Objective**: Clear horizontal lines by filling them completely
- **Scoring**: 100 points per line cleared
- **Game Over**: When a new piece can't be placed at the top
- **Piece Movement**: Pieces fall automatically every second
- **Line Clearing**: Completed lines disappear and upper lines fall down

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Haptic feedback for piece movements
- [ ] Sound effects and background music
- [ ] Multiple difficulty levels
- [ ] High score tracking
- [ ] Particle effects for line clears
- [ ] Hold piece functionality
- [ ] Next piece preview
- [ ] Multiplayer support

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Minor Swift 6.2 actor isolation warnings (non-blocking)
- Game runs smoothly but could benefit from performance optimizations

## 📱 Compatibility

- **iOS Version**: 26.0+
- **Devices**: iPhone, iPad
- **Simulator**: iOS Simulator with external keyboard support
