## üõ†Ô∏è Recent Fixes

The project had several issues that have been resolved:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:
1. **Actor Isolation Errors**: Removed conflicting `@MainActor` annotations that were causing build failures
2. **Missing Type Definitions**: Properly defined `TetriminoBlock`, `GameUpdateResult`, and `PiecePosition` structs
3. **Incomplete Game Logic**: Implemented full piece movement, spawning, and game loop
4. **Concurrency Issues**: Fixed async/await usage in the game engine
5. **UI Integration**: Properly connected SpriteKit scene with game logic

### üîß Technical Improvements:

- **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful handling of game over conditions
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient rendering and update loops

## üéØ How to Play

### Touch Controls
- **Left third of screen**: Move piece left
- **Right third of screen**: Move piece right  
- **Center third of screen**: Rotate piece

### Keyboard Controls (iOS Simulator/External Keyboard)

#### Movement Controls
- **Left Arrow** or **A**: Move piece left
- **Right Arrow** or **D**: Move piece right

#### Rotation Controls
- **Up Arrow**, **W**, **X**, or **K**: Rotate piece clockwise
- **Z** or **L**: Rotate piece counter-clockwise

#### Drop Controls
- **Down Arrow**: Soft drop (move piece down faster)
- **Spacebar**: Hard drop (instantly place piece at lowest position)

#### Game Controls
- **R**: Restart game
- **C**: Hold piece (coming soon)

#### Alternative Controls
- **WASD**: Alternative movement and rotation
- **Arrow Keys**: Standard movement and rotation

## üöÄ Building and Running

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Xcode 16.0 or later
   - iOS 26.0 SDK
   - Swift 6.2

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   cd hellotetris
   xcodebuild -project hellotetris.xcodeproj -scheme hellotetris -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
   ```

3. **Run in Simulator**:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project hellotetris.xcodeproj -scheme hellotetris -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
   ```

## üé® Game Architecture

### Core Components:

1. **GameEngine (Actor)**: 
   - Manages game state
   - Handles piece movement and collision detection
   - Thread-safe operations

2. **GameBoard (Class)**:
   - Represents the game grid
   - Handles piece placement and line clearing
   - Collision detection

3. **TetriminoPiece (Observable Class)**:
   - Defines piece shapes and rotations
   - Color and visual properties
   - All 7 standard Tetris pieces

4. **GameScene (SKScene)**:
   - SpriteKit rendering
   - Touch input handling
   - Visual feedback

## üéØ Game Rules

- **Objective**: Clear horizontal lines by filling them completely
- **Scoring**: 100 points per line cleared
- **Game Over**: When a new piece can't be placed at the top
- **Piece Movement**: Pieces fall automatically every second
- **Line Clearing**: Completed lines disappear and upper lines fall down

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [x] ‚úÖ Haptic feedback for piece movements
- [x] ‚úÖ iOS 26 Liquid Glass UI components
- [x] ‚úÖ Particle effects for enhanced visuals
- [x] ‚úÖ ProMotion 120Hz support
- [ ] Sound effects and background music
- [ ] Multiple difficulty levels
- [ ] High score tracking
- [ ] Hold piece functionality
- [ ] Next piece preview
- [ ] Multiplayer support
- [ ] Apple Intelligence integration for adaptive difficulty

## üêõ Known Issues
